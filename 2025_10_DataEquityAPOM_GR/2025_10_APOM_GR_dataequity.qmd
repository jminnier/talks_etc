# What is Data Equity?

[![UMD Library Guide](img/legos_umd_lib.png){fig-alt="Pieces of yellow lego does not equal diverse lego people"}](https://lib.guides.umd.edu/ResearchEquity/DataEquity)

## What is Data Equity?

-   The consideration of issues of power, bias, and discrimination in how data is collected, analyzed, interpreted, and used

-   Ensuring research benefits all populations equitably, especially those historically marginalized or underrepresented

-   Recognition that data is not neutral - it reflects existing social structures and biases

-   Allow community and patient participation in the research process, ensure trust and accessibility, with the goal of data sovereignty

-   Ultimately, data equity seeks to achieve just, unbiased, and actionable insights that enhance care quality and reduce disparities across diverse patient populations

## Data Equity Principles

[![CDC Foundation Data Equity Principles](img/cdc-foundation-data-equity-principles-life-cycle.png){fig-alt="CDC Foundation Data Equity Principles"}](https://www.cdcfoundation.org/data-equity-principles?inline)

# Equity-minded Research

-   Recognize and define systemic factors
-   Inclusive data collection
-   [Representative sampling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02665-1)
-   Contextual analysis
    -   Researchers must understand and reflect on their own biases and assumptions, as well as identity and experiences relative to others ([positionality](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/exploring-individual-and-institutional-positionality))
-   Equitable interpretation
-   Responsible reporting

## Example: Sampling

### Unrepresentative or skewed sampling can impact patient safety and outcome prediction

-   A clinical risk assessment tool trained on a homogeneous population can mis-classify risk for underrepresented groups
-   Rates of adverse events can be over- or under-estimated in certain groups

![](img/auc_ex_fig.png){fig-align="center"}

## Common Data Equity Challenges

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
-   Selection bias in sampling
    - Ex: research in large academic medical centers may exclude rural populations or those with limited access to care

-   Missing or incomplete data for certain populations
    - Ex: language barriers may lead to incomplete data


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
![](img/urban_rural.png)
:::
:::::

-   Limited access to data collection resources
    - Ex: rural areas often lack infrastructure for comprehensive health data collection, resulting in urban-centric health policies
    - Ex: limited availability of trained medical interpreters for patients who speak less common languages, resulting in incomplete information for these populations
    
## Common Data Equity Challenges

-   Inappropriate aggregation of diverse groups

    -   Ex: collapsing Asian American subgroups can mask disparities, [Haelle 2022, Association of Health Care Journalists](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2022/08/how-improper-aggregation-of-racial-ethnic-groups-in-research-can-mask-health-disparities/)
    -   Ex: prevalence of asthma varies across US-born vs non-US-born Latinos `r Cite(key="marino2023disaggregating", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

-   Lack of contextual variables

    -   Ex: a study on asthma prevalence may fail to account for air quality or housing conditions, focusing on individual-level factors but missing community-level determinants of health

## Common Data Equity Challenges

-   Historical unethical studies and misuse of demographic data

    -   Many examples of unethical and harmful medical research on African Americans, leading to mistrust of medical research in the Black communities, leading to underpresentation in studies
    -   Tuskegee syphilis study is just one example `r Cite(key = "katz2006tuskegee", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

# Sex and Gender Considerations

![NIH Sex and Gender](img/nih_sex_gender.png)

[NIH Sex and Gender](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender)

## Sex and Gender in Statistical Models

### Best Practices

-   Distinguish between sex and gender variables
-   Consider both biological and social factors
-   Avoid binary assumptions
-   Document missing data patterns

### Common Pitfalls

-   Conflating sex and gender
-   Systemic lack of female representation (as well as omissions of transgender and intersex populations or persons with variations in sex characteristics)
-   Assuming homogeneity within groups
-   Overlooking interaction effects
-   Missing intersectional perspectives

## Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV)

### Key Considerations

-   Hormonal influences
-   Genetic differences
-   Physiological variations
-   Life-cycle changes

### Implementation Strategies

-   Include adequate sample sizes for all sexes
-   Test for sex-specific effects
-   Report sex-disaggregated results
-   Consider sex-based biological mechanisms

# Race and Ethnicity in Research

> Race is a social construct, commonly used in epidemiologic research to adjust for confounding. However, adjustment of race may mask racial disparities, thereby perpetuating structural racism.

"We adjusted for race": now what? A systematic review... `r Cite(key = "swilley2023we", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

## Race and Ethnicity: Critical Considerations

-   Race is a social construct, not biological
-   Substantial within-group variation
-   Historical context of racial categories
-   Context of discriminatory, sociocultural, or biological effects associated with race or SDOH variable used
-   Intersectionality with other variables

## Race and Ethnicity: Recommendations

-   Use clearly defined categories, standard and not collapsed categories when possible
    -   Avoid collapsing categories of race with disparate health outcomes
    -   Avoid label "other", use descriptive terms for collapsed categories
    -   Include ethnicity and ancestry information
-   Clearly document data collection and classification methods
-   If using race as a confounder, covariate, or adjustment variable, examine effect modification
-   Acknowledge limitations

[US Dept of Health & Human Services: Healthy People 2030](https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health)

## Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)

### Design considerations

-   Equitable sampling
-   Missing data issues
-   Granular data collection
-   Standardization of variable definitions

### Integration Strategies

-   Including SDOH variables in models can be complex
-   Consider mediating effects or effect modification
-   Document contextual factors
-   Consider correlation/collinearity
-   Address missing data

`r Cite(key = "braveman2023social", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

# Statistical Analysis Considerations

We adjusted for ....

## Statistical Analysis, Adjustment

What does controlling for race (or sex, or gender, or SDOH) mean?

-   Adjustment, matching, stratification, etc. estimates effects over all strata to present an overall effect between exposure and outcome

-   When adjusting for the social construct of race, the adjusted effect estimate can be interpreted as the exposure-outcome relationship if racism did not affect the exposure

-   Pooled effects are weighted toward the larger group

-   Effect measure modification allows for different effects within groups (race, gender, sex, etc)

`r Cite(key = "swilley2023we", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

## Statistical Analysis Considerations

### Model Development

-   Variable selection and coding
-   Interaction testing
-   Missing data patterns
-   Model assumptions

### Interpretation

-   Effect modification
-   Confounding
-   Mediation
-   Population-specific effects

## Modeling Decisions

-   **Bivariate Model**: Use when asking "Does a demographic group receive access at different rates?"
-   **Multiple Regression**: Use when asking "Do similarly situated individuals access benefits at the same rate?"

# Modeling Examples

## Example 1: Postoperative Opioid Prescribing

-   **Research Question:** Are there racial disparities in the amount of opioids prescribed to patients at discharge after a total knee arthroplasty?
-   **Outcome (Y):** Total morphine milligram equivalents (MME) prescribed.
-   **Attribute of Interest (X):** Patient race (e.g., Black vs. White).

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
***Bivariate Regression Model:***

`lm(MME ~ patient_race, data = surgical_data)`

**Interpretation:** "On average, do Black patients receive different MME prescriptions at discharge compared to White patients?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
***Multiple Regression Model:***

`lm(MME ~ patient_race + preoperative_pain_score + procedure_time, data = surgical_data)`

**Interpretation:** "Among patients with similar pre-op pain and procedure times, is there still a difference in MME prescriptions between Black and White patients?"
:::
:::::

## Discussion: Post-attribute Bias

Be cautious controlling for in-hospital patient-reported pain.

-   If provider bias (related to race) leads to under-treatment of pain, the Black patient might report higher pain scores.
-   Controlling for this pain score could incorrectly make a lower MME prescription seem medically justified, thereby masking the original bias.
-   The bivariate model may be more appropriate.

**Post-attribute bias** occurs when we control for variables that may be affected by the attribute we’re studying (aka post-treatment bias, intermediate variable bias, mediating variable bias)

## Example 2: Use of Regional Anesthesia

-   **Research Question:** Does insurance type influence whether a patient receives regional anesthesia (e.g., a nerve block) for shoulder surgery, which can reduce postoperative pain and opioid use?
-   **Outcome**: Receipt of nerve block (Yes/No, a binary outcome).
-   **Attribute of Interest:** Insurance type (e.g., Private vs. Medicaid).

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
***Bivariate Regression Model:***

`glm(nerve_block ~ insurance_type, family = "binomial", data = ortho_data)`

**Interpretation:** "On average, are patients with Medicaid less likely to receive a nerve block than patients with private insurance?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
***Multiple Regression Model:***

`glm(nerve_block ~ insurance_type + patient_asa_score + hospital_type, family = "binomial", data = ortho_data)`

**Interpretation:** "Controlling for patient health status (ASA score) and the type of hospital (e.g., teaching vs. non-teaching), are Medicaid patients still less likely to receive a nerve block?"
:::
:::::

## Discussion: Omitted Variable Bias

-   Failing to control for patient health status (a key confounder) could lead to incorrect conclusions if, for instance, Medicaid patients in your sample have more comorbidities that contraindicate a nerve block.
-   Insurance is associated with ASA score
-   Hospital type may also be related to use of nerve block or insurance type rates
-   The full model provides a more complete picture.

## Example 3: 30-Day Hospital Readmission

-   **Research Question:** Are patients with Limited English Proficiency (LEP) at higher risk for readmission after major abdominal surgery?
-   **Outcome**: Readmitted within 30 days (Yes/No).
-   **Attribute of Interest:** LEP status (e.g., needs interpreter vs. English proficient).

::::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
***Bivariate Regression Model:***

`glm(readmitted ~ lep_status, family = "binomial", data = surgery_discharge_data)`

**Interpretation:** "Do patients with LEP have a higher 30-day readmission rate?"
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
***Multiple Regression Model:***

`glm(readmitted ~ lep_status + surgical_complexity + length_of_stay, family = "binomial", data = surgery_discharge_data)`

**Interpretation:** "After accounting for how sick the patient was (surgical complexity, length of stay), does LEP status remain a predictor of readmission?"
:::
:::::

## Discussion: Disparities

-   This highlights the difference between asking "are there disparities?" (bivariate) versus "what are the mechanisms?" (multivariable). The first question is often the most important for identifying a problem that needs fixing.
-   The disparity in readmission may be caused by inadequate discharge communication, which is part of the mechanism of inequity for LEP patients.

## Using Regression to Detect Discrimination

-   Cannot definitively prove discrimination
-   Cannot definitively prove lack of discrimination
-   Unmeasured variables may explain disparities
-   Need robust research design for causal claims

## Best Practices for Reporting

-   Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) Guidelines `r Cite(key = "heidari2016sex", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`
-   Race, ethnicity guidelines often journal or study design specific `r Cite(key = "flanagin2021updated", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`
