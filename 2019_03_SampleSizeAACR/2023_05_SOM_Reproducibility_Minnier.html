# What are the different kinds of reproducibile research?

&gt; Victoria Stodden, a prominent scholar on this topic, has identified some useful distinctions in reproducible research:

&gt; **Computational reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about code, software, hardware and implementation details.
&gt;
&gt; **Empirical reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about non-computational empirical scientific experiments and observations. In practice this is enabled by making data freely available, as well as details of how the data was collected.
&gt;
&gt; **Statistical reproducibility**: when detailed information is provided about the choice of statistical tests, model parameters, threshold values, etc. This mostly relates to pre-registration of study design to prevent p-value hacking and other manipulations.

# Goals of sample size and power calculations

- Design a study that will have enough information about underlying population to reject a hypothesis with high confidence.
- Calculate the number of sampling units (e.g. people, animals) you need to estimate statistics with a certain level of precision.

---

class: middle, center, inverse

# Design your study

---

# Step 1: State your research hypothesis

- Define your:
    + Population
    + Outcome variables/measurements
    + Predictor variables (i.e. treatment, age, genetic mutation)
- Be specific!
- Example: Among *women* (population you sample from), the *BRCA1* mutation
(predictor) is associated with an increased risk of developing *breast cancer* (outcome).
- **Question**: How many women do we need to sample/study to determine that BRCA1 is associated with breast cancer?

## Your hypothesis and design inform your analysis method.

---

# Step 2: Choose your analysis and test(s)

- You can't calculate sample size without knowing which test and model you will use.
- How will you measure your outcome? Continuous? Categorical? Binary (yes/no)?
    + choose outcomes with high sensitivity and low measurement error
- How many groups/experimental conditions/predictors?
    + the more you have the more samples you will need
- What test? t-test? Linear regression? Random effects model? Chi-square test?

## Calculate sample size based on analysis method you will use.

---

class: inverse, center, middle

# Calculate power and sample size

---

# Need to know (/tell your statistician!):

- Overall design (outcome, endpoint, hypothesis)
- Size/magnitude of effect of interest
    + What do you *hope* to detect
- Variability of measurements
    + Precision of your measurement, biological variability within population
- Level of type I error (false positive rate, significance level, `\(\alpha\)`)
- Level of power (true positive rate)
- Other design details (number of groups, clustering, repeated measures)

---

# Components of Sample Size

Need to know 3 of the 4 to determine the 4th:

Do We Know? | Measure | Definition
---|---|---
?? | Effect Size | Magnitude of difference or association; &lt;br&gt;i.e. (difference in means)/(population standard deviation) = `\(\frac{\mu_1 - \mu_0}{\sigma}\)` = `\(\frac{\delta}{\sigma}\)`
?? | Sample Size | N
0.05, 0.01 | Type I Error / Significance level | `\(\alpha\)` = probability of rejecting null hypothesis when it is true; false positive
0.9, 0.8 | Power  | 1 - `\(\beta\)` = 1 - Type II error = probability of rejecting null hypothesis when it is false; true positive

---

# What is **effect size**?

- Summarizes the outcome of interest
- Magnitude of difference or association
- Specification depends on study design and statistical model/test

---

# Discussion Questions

- How has study design and sample size/power calculations affected the studies you've worked on, were you limited by other factors (i.e. budget, time)?

- Sample size/power calculations are usually not included in manuscripts reporting results, do you think they should be?

- How does "data fishing" contribute to statistical irreproducibility? [xkcd.com/882/](https://xkcd.com/882/)

- How do new and developing technologies (i.e., single cell everything, etc.) make it difficult to design studies that fulfill statistical rigor &amp; reproducibility?

---

# Thought exercise


What details are missing from this sample size description? Could you reproduce it?

&gt; A sample size of 30 is required to have 90% power to detect an effect size of 1.2 with type I error 5%.



---


## Examples:

- Difference in treatment and control mean outcomes, relative to variance (standard deviation)
- Correlation coefficient of two biomarkers
- Risk ratio of breast cancer comparing BRCA carriers to non-carriers
- Magnitude of regression coefficient


---

# Effect size must be

- **pre-specified**
- based on what is meaningful biologically or clinically (not statistical significance)
- based on pilot data or literature review if available

---

# Simple example: T-test

Outcome = Continuous measurement, normal distribution

Predictor = Treatment yes/no (treatment vs control group)

Test: two sample T-test, equal variance

Effect Size: difference in means divided by standard deviation of population `\(\frac{\mu_{trt} - \mu_{ctrl}}{\sigma}\)`

Null Hypothesis: Difference in means = 0

Alternative Hypothesis: Difference in means `\(\neq\)` 0

**"Given a desired effect size, what sample size gives us enough information to reject the null hypothesis with power 90%, type I error 5%?"**

# n=25, effect size = 1

Power = 0.93&lt;br&gt;
(Significance based on two sample t-test for difference in means)

&lt;img src="img/hist_errorbars_nn25_sd1_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;



---

# R code for t-test, effect size = 1:


```r
power.t.test(delta = 1, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

```

     Two-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 22.0211
          delta = 1
             sd = 1
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.9
    alternative = two.sided

NOTE: n is number in *each* group
```

---

# n=25, effect size = 0.33

Increase standard deviation from 1 to 3, divides effect size by 3
&lt;br&gt;Power = 0.21

&lt;a href = "https://jminnier-talks.netlify.com/2019_03_samplesizeaacr/img/hist_errorbars_nn25_sd3_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/hist_errorbars_nn25_sd3_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

---

To detect an effect size of 0.33 with power = 0.9 and type I error = 0.05, what sample size would we need? n=194 in each group!


```r
power.t.test(delta = 0.33, sd = 1, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.9)
```

```

     Two-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 193.9392
          delta = 0.33
             sd = 1
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.9
    alternative = two.sided

NOTE: n is number in *each* group
```


---

# n=10, effect size = 1

Decrease sample size&lt;br&gt;
Power = 0.56

&lt;a href = "https://jminnier-talks.netlify.com/2019_03_samplesizeaacr/img/hist_errorbars_nn10_sd1_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/hist_errorbars_nn10_sd1_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

---

# n=3, effect size = 1

Decrease sample size even more&lt;br&gt;Power = 0.16

&lt;a href = "https://jminnier-talks.netlify.com/2019_03_samplesizeaacr/img/hist_errorbars_nn3_sd1_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;img src="img/hist_errorbars_nn3_sd1_mu00_mu11_nsims10.gif"&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

---

# n = 3, power = 0.9, effect size = ?



In the `R` output below, the effect size is delta/sd = 3.59/1 = 3.59.


```r
power.t.test(n=3, sd=1, sig.level=0.05, power=0.9)
```

```

     Two-sample t test power calculation 

              n = 3
          delta = 3.589209
             sd = 1
      sig.level = 0.05
          power = 0.9
    alternative = two.sided

NOTE: n is number in *each* group
```

# Other reasons to calculate sample size

## Precision of statistics

- Sample sizes can also be calculated for a specific maximum width in confidence interval around an estimate
- i.e. we will estimate the proportion with a 95% confidence interval of width 0.1 such as [0.2, 0.3]

## Prediction models

- Large sample sizes are needed for complex prediction models.
- Stability of prediction model accuracy measures depends on sample size.

---

# Important to remember:

## Sample size estimates are ESTIMATES.

- based on assumptions that could be incorrect
- based on pilot data that could be a poor sample or too small
- the more you don't know, the more conservative you should be (inflate your `\(n\)`)
- good to provide multiple estimates for a variety of scenarios/effects
