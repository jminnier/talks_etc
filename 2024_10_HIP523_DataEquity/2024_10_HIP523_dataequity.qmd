## What is Data Equity?

-   The consideration of issues of power, bias, and discrimination in how data is collected, analyzed, interpreted, and used

-   Ensuring research benefits all populations equitably

-   Recognition that data is not neutral - it reflects existing social structures and biases

-   Allow community participation in the research process, ensure trust and accessibility, with the goal of data sovereignty

# Equity-minded Research

-   Recognize and define systemic factors
-   Inclusive data collection
-   [Representative sampling](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-023-02665-1)
-   Contextual analysis
    -   Researchers must understand and reflect on their own biases and assumptions, as well as identity and experiences relative to others ([positionality](https://www.urban.org/research/publication/exploring-individual-and-institutional-positionality))
-   Equitable interpretation
-   Responsible reporting

## Common Data Equity Challenges

-   Selection bias in sampling

    -   Ex: research in large academic medical centers may exclude rural populations or those with limited access to care

-   Missing or incomplete data for certain populations

    -   Ex: language barriers may lead to incomplete data

-   Inappropriate aggregation of diverse groups

    -   Ex: collapsing Asian American subgroups can mask disparities, [Haelle 2022, Association of Health Care Journalists](https://healthjournalism.org/blog/2022/08/how-improper-aggregation-of-racial-ethnic-groups-in-research-can-mask-health-disparities/)
    -   Ex: prevalence of asthma vaaries across US-born vs non-US-born Latinos `r Cite(key="marino2023disaggregating", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

## Common Data Equity Challenges

-   Lack of contextual variables

    -   Ex: a study on asthma prevalence may fail to account for air quality or housing conditions, focusing on individual-level factors but missing community-level determinants of health

-   Limited access to data collection resources

    -   Ex: rural areas often lack infrastructure for comprehensive health data collection, resulting in urban-centric health policies

## Common Data Equity Challenges

-   Historical unethical studies and misuse of demographic data

    -   Many examples of unethical and harmful medical research on African Americans, leading to mistrust of medical research in the Black communities, leading to underpresentation in studies
    -   Tuskegee syphilis study is just one example `r Cite(key = "katz2006tuskegee", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

## Sex and Gender in Statistical Models

### Best Practices

-   Distinguish between sex and gender variables
-   Consider both biological and social factors
-   Avoid binary assumptions
-   Document missing data patterns

### Common Pitfalls

-   Conflating sex and gender
-   Assuming homogeneity within groups
-   Overlooking interaction effects
-   Missing intersectional perspectives

## Sex as a Biological Variable (SABV)

### Key Considerations

-   Hormonal influences
-   Genetic differences
-   Physiological variations
-   Life-cycle changes

### Implementation Strategies

1.  Include adequate sample sizes for all sexes
2.  Test for sex-specific effects
3.  Report sex-disaggregated results
4.  Consider sex-based biological mechanisms

[National Institutes of Health (NIH) SABV Policy](https://orwh.od.nih.gov/sex-gender/orwh-mission-area-sex-gender-in-research/nih-policy-on-sex-as-biological-variable)

# Race and Ethnicity in Research

> Race is a social construct, commonly used in epidemiologic research to adjust for confounding. However, adjustment of race may mask racial disparities, thereby perpetuating structural racism.

"We adjusted for race": now what? A systematic review... `r Cite(key = "swilley2023we", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

## Race and Ethnicity: Critical Considerations

-   Race is a social construct, not biological
-   Substantial within-group variation
-   Historical context of racial categories
-   Context of discriminatory, sociocultural, or biological effects associated with race or SDOH variable used
-   Intersectionality with other variables

## Race and Ethnicity: Recommendations

-   Use clearly defined categories, standard and not collapsed categories when possible
    -   Avoid collapsing categories of race with disparate health outcomes
    -   Avoid label "other", use descriptive terms for collapsed categories
    -   Include ethnicity and ancestry information
-   Clearly document data collection and classification methods
-   If using race as a confounder, covariate, or adjustment variable, examine effect modification
-   Acknowledge limitations

# Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)

![](img/Healthy%20People%202030%20SDOH%20Graphic%20Domain%20Labels.png)

[US Dept of Health & Human Services: Healthy People 2030](https://odphp.health.gov/healthypeople/priority-areas/social-determinants-health)

## Social Determinants of Health (SDOH)

### Design considerations

-   Equitable sampling
-   Missing data issues
-   Granular data collection
-   Standardization of variable definitions

### Integration Strategies

-   Including SDOH variables in models can be complex
-   Consider mediating effects or effect modification
-   Document contextual factors
-   Consider correlation/collinearity
-   Address missing data

`r Cite(key = "braveman2023social", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

# Statistical Analysis Considerations

We adjusted for ....

## Statistical Analysis, Adjustment

What does controlling for race (or sex, or gender, or SDOH) mean?

-   Adjustment, matching, stratification, etc. estimates effects over all strata to present an overall effect between exposure and outcome

-   When adjusting for the social construct of race, the adjusted effect estimate can be interpreted as the exposure-outcome relationship if racism did not affect the exposure

-   Pooled effects are weighted toward the larger group

-   Effect measure modification allows for different effects within groups (race, gender, sex, etc)

`r Cite(key = "swilley2023we", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`

## Statistical Analysis Considerations

### Model Development

-   Variable selection and coding
-   Interaction testing
-   Missing data patterns
-   Model assumptions

### Interpretation

-   Effect modification
-   Confounding
-   Mediation
-   Population-specific effects

## Interactive Examples

-   Shiny App: [https://ohsu-berd.shinyapps.io/equity_regression/](https://ohsu-berd.shinyapps.io/equity_regression/ )
-   Business relief program funding: Women-owned and Black-owned businesses
-   Examples and code from US Government [Office of Evaluation Sciences (OES)](https://oes.gsa.gov/methods/) Equity Evaluation Series ["Choosing Cotrols in Regression Analyses Involving Equity"](https://oes.gsa.gov/assets/files/choosing-controls-in-regression-analyses-involving-equity.pdf)

## Modeling Decisions

-   **Bivariate Model**: Use when asking "Does a demographic group receive access at different rates?"
-   **Multiple Regression**: Use when asking "Do similarly situated individuals access benefits at the same rate?"

### Using Regression to Detect Discrimination

-   Cannot definitively prove discrimination
-   Unmeasured variables may explain disparities
-   Need robust research design for causal claims

## Best Practices for Reporting

-   Sex and Gender Equity in Research (SAGER) Guidelines `r Cite(key = "heidari2016sex", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`
- Race, ethnicity guidelines often journal or study design specific `r Cite(key = "flanagin2021updated", bib=myBib, textual = TRUE, .opts=list(cite.style="authoryear"))`
